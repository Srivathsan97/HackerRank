The 30 Days of Code repo provides you with both questions and the respective solutions in "Python 3.0"

PS : Planning to upgrade the repor with other languages like C++, C etc.

NOTE:
In the HackerRank website, there may be questions which have stub code that must/can never be changed.
Those codes are mentioned between "#locked" in the beginning and the end of the codes in Answers

Eg:
Day 12 : Inheritance

#locked

class Person:

	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber):
	
		self.firstName = firstName
		
		self.lastName = lastName
		
		self.idNumber = idNumber
		
	def printPerson(self):
	
		print("Name:", self.lastName + ",", self.firstName)
		
		print("ID:", self.idNumber)
		
#locked

Copying and pasting the "#locked" codes will generate error and may not compile as required.

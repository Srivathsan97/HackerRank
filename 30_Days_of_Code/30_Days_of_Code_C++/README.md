The 30 Days of Code repo provides you with both questions and the respective solutions in "C++"

PS : Planning to upgrade the repo with other languages like C, Java etc.

NOTE:
In the HackerRank website, there may be questions which have stub code that must/can never be changed.
Those codes are mentioned between "#locked" in the beginning and the end of the codes in Answers

Eg:
Day 21 : Generics

//locked
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;
//locked

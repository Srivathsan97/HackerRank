"""
Arithmetic operators are the operators used to perform basic mathematical operations, like multiplication , addition etc., on the intergers/float variables
Apart from arithmetic operators, there are other operations like comparison operators, assignment operators etc.

NOTE: +(addition) and *(multiplication) operators can be used with strings as concatenators

Example 1:
a = 9
b = 3
print(a + b) 

Example 2:
a = 90
b = 30
print(a - b)

Example 3:
a = 2
b = 5
print(a * b)

Example 4:
print(float(10%9*1+2-5/3))
print(10%9*1+2-5/3)
print(int(10%9*1+2-5/3))

Example 5:
print("Hi " + "Human Being")

Example 6:
print("Hi " * 5, end = "\nPrinted Hi 5 times")
